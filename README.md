1) Clone repo into local folder

2) You'll need an extension to run a live server.
   • For Atom, you can download Atom Live Server https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server
   • For VS Code, Live Server works great https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server
   
3) Open index.html using your live server.

You may encounter an issue the first time you start the server, the header of index.html will display but the rest of the
content may not. If you open the console in your browser, you should see an error directing you to line 64 of index.html.
Simply open that file, and save it, your live server should reload, displaying all content correctly.
